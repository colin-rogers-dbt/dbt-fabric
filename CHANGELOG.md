# Changelog

## v1.8.4

### Under the hood

* Wrap our invocations of `USE [database];` into a new macro, `get_use_database_sql`, to allow adapters than inheirit it to disable by default where it is not supported (e.g. dbt-synapse)

### v1.8.0rc2

## Bug Fixes
* Remove dbt-adapters requirement in setup.py, and specify commit SHA of dbt-core and dbt-adapters in dev_requirements.txt, to fix `make dev`
* Fix failing test `tests/functional/adapter/test_query_comment.py::TestMacroArgsQueryComments::test_matches_comment` to use correct dbt_version, see [dbt-core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/tests/functional/adapter/query_comment/test_query_comment.py)
